Game                  : Doom2

Description           : 21 levels of fire-eating deathmatch.
                        You won't get tired of this.  By the way
                        if you're one of those who plays the first
                        2 maps and says, "Eh..", start on 12 so you
                        can see the really good ones.  Many of these
                        maps will look like other maps... Well, my
                        excuse is that any good WAD builder needs
                        inspiration.  So I take the ideas out of
                        popular WADs and tweak them a little, making
                        them much better, and of course I make all my
                        stuff from scratch remember..  Everything in this
                        package was made by ME, Fuzz.  Hope you like it,
                        and I'll tell ya right now my favorite map is 20.
                        Have fun and dont forget to try my patches...
                        See ya on DWANGO...

Side Note             : It never made it to 32 maps.  I was done with 21.
                        Sory to all you fools who were looking for more.
                        The 21 that are here should be quite nice.

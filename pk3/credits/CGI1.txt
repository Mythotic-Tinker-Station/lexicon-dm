Misc. Author Info       : Do not be fooled by the goats. They are dangerous,
                          they are cunning, they are sneaky, and they want us
                          all dead. Prepare yourself with this high-tech
                          training simulation. The goats will strike one day,
                          sooner than you think. Don't let them crush
                          civilization under their dopey hooves. 

Description             : CGI1 is a dueling mapset with 30 standard maps,
                          four gimmick maps, and a hub (Zandronum only). They
                          have been crafted and finely tuned by the best of
                          the best in the Countergoat cause.

Additional Credits to   : AlexMax for writing the initial Duel32 hub code and
                          allowing us to shamelessly steal it!
                          
                          TerminusEst13 for fixing all the ACS I tried to
                          write and ruined horribly because I am super bad at
                          reading existing ACS code!
                          
                          [IFOC]75, Combinebob, and Ru5tK1ng for some initial feedback

                          esselfortium for doing the majority of the
                          compiling in 32in24tex.wad, which is where a lot of
                          the textures came from. Also for pointing out how
                          horribly broken the ANIMATED lump was
                          
                          Baratus (Jimmybro) for assorted graphics
                          
                          SomethingAwful for the smug dog emote (and the
                          Jetsons for having it in SPACEDM5 already)
                          
                          Epic Games and Unidoom for the AWW SMACK sound

                          Nick Baker because we probably used his textures
                          somewhere
                          
                          Other texture artists whose work we may have used

                          DaniJ for constantly blocking talk of METADATA for lumps with irrelevant inane ramblings

* Play Information *

Game                    : Doom 2

Single Player           : Player starts only
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : No
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Designed for
Other game styles       : Designed for duels (1-on-1), can probably
                          comfortably fit a 2-v-2 or 4p FFA on some maps.
Difficulty Settings     : Not implemented


* Construction *

Base                    : Maps are new from scratch; hub map code is almost
                          identical to Duel32's
Build Time              : First saved wad I have dates back to November 22nd,
                          2013
Editor(s) used          : SLADE, Doom Builder 2, Paint Shop Pro 7, probably
                          more
Known Bugs              : None in Zandronum; MAP98 and BUNKER will crash
                          ZDaemon and any other port that doesn't recognize
                          UDMF. MAP03 easter egg will not show up in ZDaemon.
                          MAP90 will display <!>s instead of slimers in
                          ZDaemon. Odamex has all sorts of zany nonsensical
                          bugs. Load into other source ports at your own
                          risk.
May Not Run With        : (G)ZDoom will crash because of a Zandronum-only MAPINFO code word.
                          Most Boom-capable source ports should load the wad
                          fine, but it's only recommended to use...

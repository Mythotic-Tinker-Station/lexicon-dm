Description             : Ummm... Here.  These are all deathmatch levels, a
                          few of them actually contain monsters, but who 
                          cares.  SynJ1 starts out very primitivly,  as you
                          can tell, and show the progression of my level 
                          making.  SynJ4, 7, and 8 are the most liked by 
                          the small audience I have.  
                          
                             I made these because in Doom ][, I believe, 
                          the levels are too cramped or spacious for 
                          deathmatch.  They weren't good for 2-4 players at
                          all.  Maybe Co-op.. maybe.  I never used co-op in
                          Doom ][.  
                          
                             SYNJ1 is a medium sized level, with small 
                          mazes to get to rocket launcher, teleports, 
                          health, and super shotgun.  Great for quick 
                          getaways.
                          
                             SYNJ2 is huge.  Traps all over, watch your 
                          step!  Large bridges with maybe goodies, maybe 
                          death.  And with that rad suit on you'd better be
                          sure, or else you stay down there for a while. 
                          
                             SYNJ3 is in resemblence to synj2, only easier 
                          to find eachother and no real large battlefield, 
                          just running your ass off over bridges, jumping 
                          out windows, teleporting..  (HINT: There's a 
                          secret lair.. trigger the switch with the post)
                          
                             SYNJ4 is a slightly big wad, only for some 
                          reason everyone bumps into eachother within 20 
                          seconds (not garanteed), and short routes to 
                          every part in the level.
                          
                             SYNJ5 is castle-like, semi-big.  All weapons 
                          including BFG.  Follow the lava flow down into a 
                          secret ammo containing area.  Jump across to the 
                          plasma. 
                          
                             SYNJ6 resembles synj4.  There usually is huge 
                          chaos and missles flying around so much that 
                          you'd think it was air.  People screaming through
                          the halls of the sewer containing the missle 
                          launcher,  splattered bodies, etc. Of course, if 
                          no one fights over the missle launcher, there's a
                          huge plasma fight.
                          
                             SYNJ7 is a great 4 player, where 2 people will
                          be on one team and 2 on the other in deathmatch -
                          no altdeath.  Watch the blood fly.  And look for 
                          the huge "SynJ" in the ground outside.  Every 
                          weapon but the BFG.  Two alternate doors on each 
                          side of the outside.  Usually there will be an 
                          endless fight in 4 player with missles, chaingun,
                          rockets, plasma, shotguns, and the excitement 
                          rules.
                          
                             SYNJ8 is the same for synj7, only the fights 
                          will occur more, since the battleground is not as
                          large, and filled with windows and bars.  Every 
                          weapon but the BFG.  At the time this is my 
                          latest, and have not tested it out that much.  It
                          is largely decorated, and with the 1 on 1 I 
                          tested it on, dispersed fighting occured, not 
                          hanging around the same area all the time.  I 
                          always spotted him, and he always spotted me 
                          within 15 seconds - Not waiting.

                          ...Again, I wrote a lot more, but a
                          few were compilations and updates of
                          other ones (i.e. Houses 1.3).

Upcoming WADs by Author : An entire episode for DOOM one. There
                          are three of them out at the moment.

* WAD Description *

Brief Description       : A ten-level collection of houses. I
                          have fixed everything enough to
                          please myself, the perfectionist.
                          
Cool Stuff              : + 10 new house levels ready for
                            deathmatch.
                          + LOTS of new sounds. There is no
                            stupid pistol sound that sounds
                            like someone hit a drum and then
                            whistled, like in HALLS1-9.
                          + Cool new status bar that I made
                            myself. It shows how far a crappy
                            paint program can go. It's too bad
                            I can't make a picture from scratch
                            do that.
                          + Levels 3-6 are self-playable.
                          + Includes Beavis & Butt-Head's house.
                          + ...and more...!
WAD Info in More Detail : A year ago, I downloaded some 32 level
                          deathmatch collections. They had a few
                          houses in them, so I thought I would
                          take most of them and fix them up.
                          After more fixing and adding stuff,
                          this is the latest result. It sure is
                          a lot better than the first version.

Story Line              : Have you ever been told, as a kid,
                          "Don't fire rockets in the house!"
                          Or how about, "Quit sawing your
                          brother in half! He's already got
                          negative frags."
                          It probably hasn't happened to you,
                          but now you can run and play in the
                          house now. The double-barreled
                          shotguns await you.

* Construction *

Base                    : Modified WADs
Main Editor(s) used     : DMapEdit 4.0.11, Deutex 3.6
Other Editor(s) used    : EnDOOMer 1.0.1, DEU 5.21, ADE2 5.25,
                          NeoPaint 2.2, UnGOB.
Build Time              : There has been many updates of this,
                          so I wouldn't know. Estimating from
                          the looks of the WAD, it looks like it
                          would take a maximum of 2 solid
                          months.
Known Bugs              : None.
Other Problems          : None, unless you have a different
                          version of DOOM II and it crashes with
                          a demo problem.
Future Improvements     : Houses 1.5, maybe.

* Installation *

Put the WAD in your DOOM2 directory, bla bla bla!

Required to Have in Dir : Just the WAD.

* Troubleshooting *

Problem: The game kicks me out and says, "Demo is from a
         different game version!"
Solution: Those internal demos were rocorded with 1.9. Why not
          upgrade to that?

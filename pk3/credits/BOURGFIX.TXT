NOTE - BOURGFIX is still compatible with demos recorded for BOURGDM.WAD!
The _only_ change is that the exits are now silent rather than having 
a "BIG BADDA BOOM" as Coincident so eloquently described it :)

Description             : 30 maps suitable for Deathmatch, Singleplayer, or
                          Cooperative. This set is a combination of brand new
                          levels and remixed/demade maps from the authors'
                          previous projects: Don't Be A Bitch Remastered
                          (dbabrm.pk3), Aeon Deathmatch (AeonDM.pk3),
                          Progressive Duel 2 (Progduel2.pk3) and Neon
                          Deathmatch (NeonDM.pk3) which required advanced
                          engines but are now completely vanilla and Unity
                          compatible. It was not an easy task bringing them
                          from UDMF format for Zandronum to vanilla! Although
                          it is primarily a Deathmatch set, it is fully
                          Single Player and Cooperative compatible, with
                          changes in the map layouts to make them more
                          interesting. Additionally, difficulty settings have
                          been thoroughly implemented. Enjoy!
                          
                          Note: Press F1 in game for map authors. Decay did
                          the SP gameplay alterations for all maps except for
                          04, 07 (Doomkid did these) and 10, 22 (Razgriz did
                          these... mostly..)

Additional Credits to   : All new textures are patched from stock textures
                          either in Slade or MS Paint by one of the authors.
                          The handful of new MIDIs files are by Doomkid, the
                          rest are taken from Doom, Doom 2 and Final Doom.

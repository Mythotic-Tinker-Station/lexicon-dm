1. ANNOUNCEMENT
---------------

            TeamTNT proudly announces the release of

                  +--------------------------+
                  | Bloodlands - Episode One |
                  |   The Deathmatch Levels  |
                  +--------------------------+

Bloodlands is a set of 32 DOOM II Deathmatch-only levels from 
TeamTNT.  It is now available on ftp.cdrom.com and its mirrors.  
See below for the exact path.

We tried to pay attention to deathmatch in Icarus: Alien Vanguard, 
but there's no substitute for dedication.  Bloodlands is all
deathmatch, all the time.  We have small levels for tight, high
frag-count mayhem, and larger ones for more players and for the
folks who like hunt-and-seek deathmatch.  But in every case it's
going to be a fun time.

You wondered what happened to the weekend when you played Icarus.  
You'll wonder what happened to the month when you play Bloodlands.

Features:

 - 32 brand new levels by some of the best Deathmatchers
 - Difficulty levels used to fine-tune game rules
 - Three 5-minute fragfest demos with 3 and 4 players
 - All in one WAD, easy to run
 - Works with DOOM II version 1.9 or Final DOOM
 - Intermission music by David Shaw
 - Small overall WAD size of 3MB, zipped to fit on a diskette
 - It's by TeamTNT members, so you know it's good
 - Startup batch file included
 - Kept small by limiting new graphics and music


---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------
Bloodlands comes in one WAD file, zipped into one ZIP file.  You'll
need PKUNZIP.EXE or an equivalent unzipping utility to unpack
TNTBLOOD.ZIP.  This will produce TNTBLOOD.WAD and TNTBLOOD.BAT (and
another copy of this file).

Just unzip it into your DOOM2 directory and run TNTBLOOD.BAT, or 
load TNTBLOOD.WAD in your favorite front-end program.

Floppy download:

Not a problem.  Bloodlands fits on a floppy--it's barely over a meg
when zipped.


------------------
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

Not much can go wrong, since this is just one WAD file.  However,
since not much can go wrong, something might, and maybe a few
steps here will help.

a.  First, verify that TNTBLOOD.BAT and TNTBLOOD.WAD are in your
    DOOM2 directory, and that you are in that directory when you
    type TNTBLOOD.

b.  Spell TNTBLOOD right.

c.  If it starts up and crashes with a message similar to

      "Demo is from a different version"

    then you're not running DOOM2 version 1.9.  You'll need to
    upgrade if you're going to look at the demos (which are 
    well worth the trouble).  Upgrade files are available all
    over the place, and particularly at ftp.cdrom.com or 
    ftp.idsoftware.com.  Your DOOM2 version number will appear 
    at the top of the screen while DOOM2 is initializing.

d.  If you notice that the full-screen intermission texts (like
    between MAP06 and MAP07) don't make sense any more, or that
    the automap names don't match the level names, that's because
    we chose to honor id Software's wish that we not alter their
    DOOM2.EXE file, and that's where that stuff is stored.


----------------------
4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
----------------------

   A computer that will play DOOM2 well.  Deathmatch is deathmatch,
   and you won't need any more computer or modem power than you'd 
   need with DOOM2 by itself.  

   You'll like it better if you have a good sound card, but if you
   do much deathmatch you already know that.

   The WAD file is a bit over 3MB, and you'll need about 5MB 
   free available during unzipping.

   Any other requirements (modem, network stuff) are no different
   than if you were running DOOM2 without Bloodlands.


---------------------
5. WHERE TO GET FILES
---------------------

   Bloodlands was uploaded to ftp.cdrom.com at
   1:00 PM CDT on Saturday 2 August 1996.  It will be moved to its
   own directory and will be propagated to the cdrom.com
   mirrors after that.  We expect to also upload it over the few
   days following that date, to Compuserve, AOL, Fidonet and
   possibly some others.  As of this writing, only ftp.cdrom.com
   has it, and that's the place you can be guaranteed to find
   the most recent version.

   So, FTP to ftp.cdrom.com and look in directory (mixed case)
       /pub/doom2/themes/TeamTNT

   While you're there, get Icarus if you don't already have it.

6. HOW TO GET HELP
------------------

   If it's about DOOM2 itself, contact id Software.

   If it's about Bloodlands, don't contact id Software.

   Bloodlands questions can be handled by other players on the
   usenet newsgroups, various forums on Compuserve and other
   services, and by TeamTNT by email.  Either write to us at

      teamtnt@neosoft.com

   or go to our web page at

7. SOME LEGALITIES
------------------

   Bloodlands is a copyrighted work and though free
   is not public property ("public domain").  Don't take stuff
   out of our levels, and don't take our levels out of Bloodlands.
   Bloodlands should have been free to you (connection times and
   stuff notwithstanding) and shouldn't have shown up on
   someone's DM collection or CD.  If it does, let us know right
   away.

   We thank you for trying Bloodlands.  Let us know what you think
   about it.  Try out Icarus and Final DOOM too, and check back 
   around October '96 for another episode of Bloodlands.

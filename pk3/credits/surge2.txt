Description             : The sequel to the acclaimed Surge DM.  Not just
                          small, fast paced levels this time though. And
                          not gothic either. Techno style 0wnz j00r ll4m4
                          455!

                          No vanilla doom2.exe this time.  Use a Boom
                          compatible port such as ZDaemon, Boom, MBF, SMMU,
                          ZDoom, CSDoom, Skull Tag, PrBoom, and Doom Legacy.

Additional Credits to   : * Everyone who directly and indirectly helped in the
                            creation of this WAD.
                          * The bands behind the music (from NIN and Marilyn
                            Manson to Korn and Rage Against the Machine)
                          * The Overload team, who made the WAD that inspired
                            the original Surge.
                          * Ola Bjorling, many textures are inspired by his
                            (a few of his Darkening E1 textures were possibly
                            used to create some of the Surge 2 textures, but
                            if so they have been heavily modified; blame my
                            poor memory :o )
                          * P@RaNoiD (disco_stu@libero.it) for the blue
                            cloudy sky
                          * The Requiem team for the base for the cold grey
                            sky
                          * Doom Legacy team for the 240 sky used as a base

Description		: A series of mostly DooM-themed maps that utilizes the BooM mapping format. The project has evolved to accomodate Deathmatch (Free-for-all) play, but again keeping Chaindude's 1-on-1 mapping in mind. 32 maps (including the 1-on-1 maps) is the new goal for the developing team.

Additional Credits to	: HoboMaster22, Whiteboy, Roak, FsN, deathz0r, _Dark_, and Chewy for taking the time to test as well as giving honest and invaluable feedback!

Special thanks to		: HumanBones for selecting Map04 as the February 2007 ZDaemon Open Tournament map; Wilou84 for choosing Map04 yet again for the CFD Tournament; to the players in the tournaments, and to all the new Lazarus enthusiast in the servers!

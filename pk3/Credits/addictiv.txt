                          good... But they're my first Doom2 wads.)

I'm also a co-author of the stunning 11-level episode DYSTOPIA3 (DYST3.ZIP)
and the massive 32-level REQUIEM that hasn't been released yet. 
                          
Misc. Author Info       : Who did say I'm miscellaneous, anyway?

Description             : Kill your friends, laughing sadistically on their 
                          hopeless efforts when they try to escape you. Oh, 
                          almost forgot: These places look good, too!

                          There's three demos we recorded after 4am, when the 
                          fragfest had been going on for 8 hours or so... 
                          There's some misreacting, but who cares? :)

                          All you guys who read this online in the net: 
                          this is the best looking deathmatch wad you'll ever 
                          find there. I used plenty of cool 3-d effects which
                          make these levels look more like Quake than ordinary
                          Doom2 levels...

                          Yes, I HAVE Quake. Uh, well, I think some of these
                          levels are more detailed than Quake levels, so they
                          don't look too much like Quake after all. :)

Map information:

Map01: The Great Hall
This is rather small shotguns-only level, mainly for 2-player game... But if
you need truly non-stop action, try with 4 players. But that really needs IPX
network, 4-player game with 14400 modems is SLOW! (So all you BBS players,
the later maps are for you... the large size helps the slowness)

Map02: Red Cross ?
This is a bit larger, more outdoor style level; ROCKS in 4-player game if you
have faster network than slow modems... Then a little hint: The red cross can 
give you a super shotgun... (or chaingun or berserk, depends on diff.level)

Map03: Claustrophobia
Have you ever been deathmatching in a place where there's simply no room to
make a good evasive movement? If not, this is something new to you. The level
is a small castle with narrow passageways and plenty of good snipe spots...
The way to win is to make good use of the environment. (And not get stuck in a
little room when a shotgun-addicted deathmatch terminator is on your back...)

Map04: Killer's Instict
This is the most "quakish" level of the series... Mainly indoors, and cool
architecture. In 4-player game you'll get great mass-meetings at the place 
where's chainguns... One starting place contains a secret, you can find the
berserk and an extra armor.

Map05: The Tower
This one I made because the others are not always big enough for 4 players, 
I mean good players... So this is bigger, containing more weapons and stuff. 
The main tower is the only way to get the megasphere and plasma gun... But 
these two can be "blocked" :) 

Map06: X Rivers
I hadn't used the real-3d bridge effects in a deathmatch wad before, so I did
this. The map is large enough for 4 players, but it doesn't have the plasma
gun. There's a supercharge in the middle, and it'll surely lure many players 
to their deaths... Also, it's often useful to collect the chainsaw before
going for the rocket launcher (you'll see why ;)

Map07: Deadly Architecture
This level has five different buildings... the one in the middle has dozens of
windows, and it looks like a sniper's paradise: From the two "towers" you can
see (and shoot) everything... But after all, it's very likely that somebody
gets behind you - with a rocket launcher!

Map08: Snipe spots :)
Hehe, OK, I know there's better names in existence. But this describes the
level well enough. Basically, this map is a large open area with a tower in
the middle, high ledges leading to other buildings. Again, the level is full
of pillars, windows, stairs etc. But this time, everything can be seen at 
once! God knows why it doesn't crash. :)

Weapon information:
(1=berserk, 1+1=berserk+chainsaw, +1=chainsaw) 
(3=single shotgun, 3+3=super shotgun)

===========================================================================
* Type of DOOM or DOOM II file*

New level WAD (+graphics, +demos)
PLUS a wad with new musics, selected from Ultimate Doom.

* Play Information *

Map #                   : Map 01 - Map 08 
Single Player           : Yes, but WHY? No reason for it!
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes... but again, it's totally unnecessary.
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes, this is the real thing!
Difficulty Settings     : For variance in weapons... see weapon info.
New Sounds              : No
New Music               : In the ADDMUS.WAD 
New Graphics            : Status bar, Title pic etc. and a few textures.
Demos Replaced          : All three. 

* Construction *

Base                    : New levels from scratch
                          Musics from Ultimate Doom
Build Time              : 2-6 hours per level. 
Editor(s) used          : Waded 1.83beta
                          DETH for texture aligning :)
                          BSP1.5x
Graphic and misc.editors: Deluxe Paint, Image Alchemy, GWS, Wintex, Deusf
Known Bugs              : Nope. Or.. well, you can see the sky flickering in 
                          one place in the 5th level... you'll hardly ever go
                          there, though. I couldn't fix this without reducing 
                          details which make the level so good...

May Not Run With...     : Duke Nukem 3d
                         (Knowing what age most dukers are, this must be said)
                         [Nope, I don't like Duke] 

                          In other Doom ][ versions than 1.9 you can't see the
                          demos... So when you start this in single-game for
                          looking around, press enter IMMEDIATELY at the title
                          screen, or use "-warp" option.

* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors may NOT use this wad as a base to build additional
levels. But its ideas are PD. If you want to use my levels in 
a DM-level collection cd-rom or something similar, or want to
use my status bar in your wad, PLEASE contact me first! If you
do anything to my wads without my permission, YOU WILL BE

One guy claimed to have made this wad by himself. What happened to him, 
is censored... <evil grin>

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with

intact. But add the new ftp sites when distributing...

     Let me start off by saying that this WAD is not just some slapped
together collection of half-ass WADs, just so I could say, "It was 32 maps".
These are 32 QUALITY deathmatch maps, and in my opinion, the best 32
deathmatch maps in existence.  Nor was this meant to be "fragmare.wad"
(although, all of my best deathmatch maps are in here).  I wanted the word
"hardcore" to come to mind when people played this.  FINALFRG.WAD was simply
meant to be a compilation of the best 32 DM levels... period.
     The title, "The Final Frag" signifies a couple different things.
Number one, it signifies that this will unfortunately be my final WAD before
moving on to Quake.  Number two, it signifies one of the last great stands
for the wonderful game of DOOM ][, and all the joy it's given us die-hard
deathmatchers over the past couple years.  DOOM ][ will go down in history
as, at the very least, one of THE best video games in history.  I can
honestly say, DOOM ][ is a game I will truly always love.  Those reasons
aside, I just thought it was a cool name.  Heh.
     Now with all that off my chest, I can get on with the "important" WAD
info.  =)

Title: The Final Frag
Filename: finalfrg.wad
Author: FraGMarE (Ian McPherson)
E-mail: dcipher@juno.com
Description: 32 level, full DOOM ][ deathmatch overhaul.
Release Date: October 18, 1996

-Play Information-

Map #:                      All Maps... 1 through 32.
Single Player:              No way.
Cooperative 2-4 Player:     Are you on crack?
Deathmatch 2-4 Player:      Ohhhhhhhhhh yea, aint no doubt about it!
Difficulty Settings:        Recommended- Skill 5, no monsters, old deathmatch
Sounds Replaced:            Well, just one... The DSRADIO sound was replaced
                            with the modem play sound from DOOM, DSTINK.
                            Sorry, but I'm nostalgic.
New Textures:               Yes... quite a few, but not overkill. No new
                            flats though... too much memory.
New Graphics:               Yes.  Just about all the backgrounds and
                            intermission graphics were replaced.
New Music:                  Yes.  Every music has been replaced with more
                            suitable tunes to frag by.
New Sprites:                No... wouldn't really make sense in a WAD like
                            this.
New Demos:                  Yes.  All three demos were replaced with short
                            deathmatch demos.
New Lumps:                  Yes.  Just the ENDOOM screen when you exit to
                            DOS.  I pretty much avoid messing with stuff like
                            the PLAYPAL and all the MIDI patches like the
                            plague.

-Construction-

Base: Scratch, edit, and compilation
Build Time: Way too long to admit  =)
Editor(s) Used: DOOMCAD 6.1, WinDeu32 5.23, WinTex 4.3, NWT 1.3, TED 1.2,
BSP, and WARM.
Known Bugs: Nothing major.  When you open the secret door on Map3, the ammo
on the floor suddenly raises to head level... I have no idea.  Also, there
are a couple "rocket swallowing" walls throughout the WAD, sometimes those
just cannot be fixed due to the DOOM engine's handling of linedefs.  Other
than that, I could not see anything.  I'm sure there are more, but it must
take an eagle's eye to spot them.  If you find anything major that I have
overlooked, notify me by E-mail.

-Map Descriptions-

Map01 -Singe: By Yours truly, FraGMarE.  A very classic looking level with
one long hall, a lookout, and a nifty outer courtyard.  Players who are over-
anxious to get the BFG may get stuffed with some lead.

Map02 -The Omen: By FraGMarE.  Now this level looks downright Satanic.  I
think I managed to squeeze in every unholy symbol on this one.  It is an SSG
blastfest of the highest order, with a few rocket and chaingun frags thrown
in for good measure.  It consists of an inner arena with an outer hall and a
"well of fire" that takes you straight to hell, where you gain the Rocket-
Launcher.  I left out the BFG and Plasma for the sake of the level's play and
integrity.  If you're an SSG nut, you'll love this one.

Map03 -Scorch: By FraGMarE.  A very small level with a high frag rate. It has
a Rocket Launcer in the middle and four sets of stairs leading up to lookout
rooms which each contain weapons.  There are also two trenches on either side
of the level, perfect for spying on unsuspecting foes.  The BFG is here, but
you'll have to work to find it.

Map04 -The Hook: By Spam.  Here is a smaller level, by my friend, Spam.  It
consists mainly of two parts.  An outer courtyard-like area, and a semi-
covered area where you'll find numerous weapons.  The BFG is tough to get,
as you'll see why it's called "The Hook"  Very unique level design.

Map05 -Venom: By VeNoM.  This is a very irregular level with a toxic look.
Basically just a good ole brew of nukage and lead.  >:)

Map06 -Death Zone: By ???.  Just like The Crusher, minus the rest of the
level, plus a helluva lot more death.  This is the start room of regular
Map06 with some tasteful modifications... and that's it!  It's insane.  All
weapons are here, including the BFG!  The columns were shrunk down, to allow
for more freedom of movement.  The frag rate is mind-numbing.

Map07 -Quad: By Argent.  This is awesome.  A symmetrical level with all
weapons.  Very open play... what better replacement for regular Map07?

Map08 -Plasma Hell: By FraGMarE.  I like plasma... I like it a lot.  When I
made this level, I knew it wouldn't be for everyone's taste as it only has
the SSG and Plasma... lots of Plasma.  But it plays well, and if your an
SSG/Plasma freak like me, you oughtta love this.

Map09 -The Archives: By Argent.  Originally called aoa.wad, this is another
map by Argent.  It contains all weapons except the Plasma, and the BFG can be
tough to get.  It has a library-like room, and a cool looking fireplace.
Screw silence in the library!  }:)

Map10 -Inner Sanctum: By Danzig.  I knew the danzig*.wad series was legendary
in the early days of deathmatch wads, so I also knew that at least one of
them must go into finalfrg.wad.  I picked danzg11a.wad over all the others
in that series.

Map11 -Taste: By Argent.  Here is another one from Argent.  It has all the
weapons and some pretty unique features.  One of the best things is that
there is a 4 teleporter pad that criss-cross back and forth between each
other with a chaingun in the middle... This allows for badass telefrag
dogfights between deathmatch opponnents.

Map12 -System Control: By Team TNT.  This is Map01 of tnt.wad of Final DOOM
from id.  I took out the monsters and made it a little more open.  Basically
it's the same map, "deathmatch-ized".

Map13 -Return to the Archives: By FraGMarE.  I always wanted to make a
library-type map, but I never got around to it until I started working on
finalfrg.wad.  It has all the weapons.  The level consists of a library-like
upstairs room, with rows of books.  There are two sets of stairs leading down
into a courtyard where the BFG and Plasma Gun are located.

Map14 -The Reactor: By FraGMarE.  This is my first attempt at a map with a
nuclear reactor.  It's shaped roughly like regular Map1, but plays nothing
like it.  it's very fast paced, and you can also rain on a BFGer's parade if
you use the SSG at the top of the stairs where the BFG is located.  It has
quite a few new textures.

Map15 -Nuclear Meltdown: By FraGMarE.  This was my final map that I ever
released as a separate WAD.  It was meant to be the sequel to reactor.wad,
being it my second attempt at a map with a reactor.  Once again, the ordinary
DOOM wall textures just wouldnt do for some of the ways I wanted things to
look, so I just imported my own  :).  It plays well too... with a fast frag
rate.

Map16 -Napalm: By ???.  Here is a good variation on the Map1 theme.  All the
weapons are here, and there are some nice secret areas.

Map17 -To Die: By Neil Bonner.  This is a good map by an unknown author.  It
has all the weapons.  It also has some nice-looking sector usage.  Overall,
solid map.

Map18 -The Bloodletting: By FraGMarE.  This was my first good deathmatch map.
It has all the weapons, and you get to them by teleporting into the
bloodfalls.  The SSG is placed in the center of the level for easy access.

Map19 -The Void: By Bub.  A large open level with big columns strewn through-
out.  It has all weapons and 2 teleporters which lead to rooms full of
weapons.  The tunnels are filled with ammo.

Map20 -Enigma: By ???.  This is a good classic type deathmatch map.  I has
all weapons and a large "battle room" with a lot of ammo.  Dont spend too
much time in the nukage with the BFG... it's painful.

Map21 -Carnage: By Bub.  A very unique level with all the weapons.  It has an
outer courtyard with the Plasma and BFG, but most the action takes place in
the inner part of the level.  Good level layout.

Map22 -Id: By American McGee.  This is a level from one of the id software
programmers.  It has some tricky spots like the soulsphere and BFG.  This
was American McGee's first attempt at a deathmatch only map.  Pretty damn
awesome for a first try, if ya ask me... but then again, it's an id
programmer, so whadda ya expect.

Map23 -Armageddon: By MaNCeR.  This is a pretty straightforward map with a
very high frag rate.  It is also very small.  Good technical design.

Map24 -Razor: By ???.  A small map with some very tricky hallways, great for
ambush attacks.  All the weapons are here too.  High body count here, once
again.

Map25 -Dwellar in the Cellar: By Dweller.  Another series that is legendary
among deathmatch maps is the Dweller series.  I picked this map, over all
other Dweller maps... the level design is phenomenal.

Map26 -Medideath: By Scott Smith.  A unique level with lots of usage of the
crate wall textures.  All weapons are here, and BFG is tricky to get, as it
should be in a map like this.  There are also plenty of little tricks and
puzzles in this one.

Map27 -Brimstone: By MaNCeR.  A good open map with a large outer courtyard.
Very good texture and sector usage.  The gameplay is also well balanced.
Overall, a solid map.

Map28 -Entryway:  By FraGMarE.  My conversion of regular Map1 with some
tasteful enhancements.  Basically, a deathmatch purified Map1.

Map29 -Dead Simple: By FraGMarE.  My conversion of regular Map7.  I left it
pretty much unchanged except for there are no longer any invisibility spheres
or megaspheres.  Now, instead of megaspheres, there are soulshpheres and blue
armor.

Map30 -Halls of the Doomed: By FraGMarE.  Dedicated to all the deathmatchers
in the EFnet #deathmatch on IRC.  The map is shaped like an inverted cross,
with an outer "pond of blood" with a fountain where the BFG rests.  Get to 
the BFG by walking into the far bloodfall.  You can also stop potential BFG
maniacs by shooting rockets from the small rocket room.

Map31 -Entryway: By FraGMarE.  Blast from the past, deathmatch style.  >:)

Map32 -A Classic: By ???.  A classic... take a look.

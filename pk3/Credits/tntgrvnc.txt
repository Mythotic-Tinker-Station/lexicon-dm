1. ANNOUNCEMENT
---------------

            TeamTNT proudly announces the release of

                  +--------------------------+
                  |        Grievance         |
                  |   Alas, how shall this   |
                  | bloody deed be answer'd? |
                  +--------------------------+

Grievance is another set of 32 DOOM II Deathmatch-only levels from 
TeamTNT.  It is now available on ftp.cdrom.com and its mirrors.  
See below for the exact path.

TeamTNT strikes again with yet another 32 levels of all-Deathmatch
frag mayhem.  Grievance, the followon to the popular TeamTNT
Bloodlands set of 32 DM levels, has lots of interesting architecture,
impeccable texture alignment and play balance, and (oh, yeah) FRAGS!
Frags out the wazoo.  As in Bloodlands, there's a variety of small
tight fragfests and slightly larger ones for hunting or more players,
but we tried to make sure that even in the bigger levels you have 
a good idea where your, um, "friend" is.

You wondered what happened to the weekend when you played Icarus.  
You'll wonder what happened to the month when you play Bloodlands.
You'll wonder who blew your butt off in Grievance...

Features:

 - 32 brand new levels by some of the best Deathmatchers
 - Difficulty levels used to fine-tune game rules
 - Three multiplayer fragfest demos
 - All in one WAD, easy to run
 - Works with DOOM II version 1.9 or Final DOOM
 - Intermission music by David Shaw
 - Small overall WAD size of 3MB, zipped to fit on a diskette
 - It's by TeamTNT members, so you know it's good
 - Startup batch file included
 - Kept small by limiting new graphics and music


---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------
Grievance comes in one WAD file, zipped into one ZIP file.  You'll
need PKUNZIP.EXE or an equivalent unzipping utility to unpack
TNTGRVNC.ZIP.  This will produce TNTGRVNC.WAD and TNTGRVNC.BAT (and
another copy of this file).

Just unzip it into your DOOM2 directory and run TNTGRVNC.BAT, or 
load TNTGRVNC.WAD in your favorite front-end program.

Floppy download:

Not a problem.  Grievance fits on a floppy--it's barely over a meg
when zipped.


------------------
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

Not much can go wrong, since this is just one WAD file.  However,
since not much can go wrong, something might, and maybe a few
steps here will help.

a.  First, verify that TNTGRVNC.BAT and TNTGRVNC.WAD are in your
    DOOM2 directory, and that you are in that directory when you
    type TNTGRVNC.

b.  Spell TNTGRVNC right. (we left out the vowels, so you don't
    have to remember "I before E except...")

c.  If it starts up and crashes with a message similar to

      "Demo is from a different version"

    then you're not running DOOM2 version 1.9.  You'll need to
    upgrade if you're going to look at the demos (which are 
    well worth the trouble).  Upgrade files are available all
    over the place, and particularly at ftp.cdrom.com or 
    ftp.idsoftware.com.  Your DOOM2 version number will appear 
    at the top of the screen while DOOM2 is initializing.

d.  If you notice that the full-screen intermission texts (like
    between MAP06 and MAP07) don't make sense any more, or that
    the automap names don't match the level names, that's because
    we chose to honor id Software's wish that we not alter their
    DOOM2.EXE file, and that's where that stuff is stored.


----------------------
4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
----------------------

   A computer that will play DOOM2 well.  Deathmatch is deathmatch,
   and you won't need any more computer or modem power than you'd 
   need with DOOM2 by itself.  

   You'll like it better if you have a good sound card, but if you
   do much deathmatch you already know that.

   The WAD file is a bit over 3MB, and you'll need about 5MB 
   free available during unzipping.

   Any other requirements (modem, network stuff) are no different
   than if you were running DOOM2 without Grievance.


---------------------
5. WHERE TO GET FILES
---------------------

   Grievance was uploaded to ftp.cdrom.com at
   12:01 AM CDT on Wednesday 4 December 1996.  It will be moved to 
   its own directory and will be propagated to the cdrom.com
   mirrors after that.  We will also more or less simultaneously
   upload it to Compuserve, with AOL, Fidonet, etc. following close
   behind.  Most of these locations have a waiting period before the
   files are publically available, but it won't be long...

   ftp.cdrom.com is the one place you can be guaranteed to find
   the most recent version, and you can always get to a pointer to
   the file from our web site (see below).

   So, FTP to ftp.cdrom.com and look in directory (mixed case)
       /pub/doom2/themes/TeamTNT

   While you're there, get Icarus and Bloodlands if you don't 
   already have them.

------------------
6. HOW TO GET HELP
------------------

   If it's about DOOM2 itself, contact id Software.

   If it's about Grievance, don't contact id Software.

   Grievance questions can be handled by other players on the
   usenet newsgroups, various forums on Compuserve and other
   services, and by TeamTNT by email.  Either write to us at

      info@teamtnt.com

   or go to our web page at

8. SOME LEGALITIES
------------------

   Grievance is a copyrighted work and though free
   is not public property ("public domain").  Don't take stuff
   out of our levels, and don't take our levels out of Grievance.
   Grievance should have been free to you (connection times and
   stuff notwithstanding) and shouldn't have shown up on
   someone's DM collection or CD.  If it does, let us know right
   away.  We are serious about the CD thing--no commercial
   compilations are allowed to include any TeamTNT products under
   any circumstances, even if they delete this text file...

   We thank you for trying Grievance.  Let us know what you think
   about it.  Try out Icarus, Bloodlands and Final DOOM too, and 
   keep checking our web page for other team products--we're still
   churning stuff out.

 General Info
-ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ-

Eternal Deathmatch (EDM) consists of 19 levels.  These levels use
a combination of Doom 2 textures and a hand picked set of textures from
Eternal Doom.

 Background
-ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ-

This project started after Eternal 3 was completed, although we had
wanted to do it since Eternal 2.  We wanted a set of high quality
deathmatch levels that used the Eternal textures.  We also wanted to make
sure there was a balance between level styles.  It was important to include
both the large hunt-and-kill levels, and the small fragfest levels.  We think
that a good balance has been reached!  Some of Chris' Eternal Doom levels
actually developed from a few of these deathmatch levels!  See if you can
spot similarities.

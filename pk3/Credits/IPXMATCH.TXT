Please send me an email to tell me what you think about IPXMATCH!  I love
receiving email, so any comments (good or bad) are welcome!  Do not be shy
to send a message! :-)

Please read this file carefully and entirely to learn every important detail
about IPXMATCH and... a little bit about myself :-).

This is a new (the last) IPXMATCH version.  Since IPXMATCH is now perfect
(according to my quality standards) there will be no more releases.  Anyway,
it was supposed that there would only be ONE release, but bugs easily hide
themselves :-).  This version corrects the major bug of level 21 (Escape 
from nirvana), minor bugs in levels 6 (Rocket yard) and 12 (Deadly rifles)
and a minor sky bug in levels 21 to 32.  The background musics are also 
imported in a better way so music rippers will have no more problems stealing 
them :-).  One sample demo (four players) recorded during our NETDOOM 97 
party is also included with the package.  I provided this to you because I 
want to apologize for this second (but last) release that will force you all 
to upgrade from the previous version.  Please refer to the "sample demo" 
section for more details.

The older IPXMATCH version is no longer distributed and should not be used.
Please replace your old version with the final (current) version.  Recorded
demos with the previous version will still work except if they use level 21.
To avoid any playing problems, check with all players participating in a
IPXMATCH game that everyone is using the FINAL IPXMATCH version.  To do so,
load each IPXMATCH copy on every computer in single player mode (type "DOOM2"
and press ENTER from your actual IPXMATCH directory) and check the title 
screen.  The final version clearly indicates "FINAL VERSION".

Before I forget, I want to say that I am truly sorry to bring a new version
and force everyone of you to upgrade, but I did not notice these bugs during
the month of beta testing.  Please accept my apologies.  I swear there will
not be another version.  Thanks.

See the "corrected bugs" section to learn more about the bugs which have
been removed from IPXMATCH.

Please continue to read this file to learn more about IPXMATCH.  Print it, 
frame it and place it on your room's wall (laughs).  Just joking.  Let's get 
a little more serious.  This is some kind of great deathmatch package 
specially designed for four players network games.

If you are in a hurry to see what it looks like, please make sure you 
unzipped the IPXMATCH.xxx archive in your actual unmodified DOOM II version 
1.9 and type "IM_INST" to install IPXMATCH.  Please read carefully the 
instructions and conditions on the screen:  the installation procedure may 
easily fail if you do not follow them.  IPXMATCH will backup your original 
DOOM II version 1.9 in its original directory and modify the copy's internal
WAD (IWAD) in order to install the IPXMATCH patch.  Do not attempt to play 
IPXMATCH using the provided pwads!  They need to be merged in a IWAD in order 
to all work properly!  Use IM_INST.BAT!

Miscellaneous wads info:  IPXMATCH can be played with one, two, three or 
                          four players, but will be best enjoyed with four 
                          players.  IPXMATCH can be played cooperatively to 
                          explore the levels with other players before 
                          starting a deathmatch game.  No real cooperative 
                          game is possible since no level contains monsters.
                          IPXMATCH has been created in a way that simplifies
                          its installation and use:  once installed, no pwads
                          are required at all.  It only requires about 20 MB
                          of the C: hard drive space once installed.  See 
                          the "how to play?" section below to learn what is 
                          required for IPXMATCH to work.

Description:              These wads form a deathmatch package specially
                          designed for four players deathmatch network games.
                          IPXMATCH is a compilation of numerous resources 
                          from numerous people which are listed in the 
                          "credits" section of this file.  IPXMATCH contains
                          40 new deathmatch sounds, 35 new musics, many new
                          graphics, 32 new levels, new presentation demos,
                          new sprites and other things which I forget.  After
                          IPXMATCH is installed, it occupies about 20 MB of
                          the C: hard drive space but does not require any
                          more pwads to be played!  This way, more memory is
                          left to improve the gameplay!  IPXMATCH was created
                          with the idea of providing many diverse deathmatch
                          situations which would allow infinite hours of
                          cool and intense deathmatching.

³     HOW TO PLAY?     ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ



To play IPXMATCH, unzip the IPXMATCH.xxx archive in your original unmodified 
DOOM II version 1.9 directory and type "IM_INST".  Carefully follow the 
instructions on the screen.

In order to install IPXMATCH, you must:

-- Have a minimum of 25 MB of available hard disk space on your C: drive
-- Be using DOS version 6.0 or higher
-- Have DOOM II version 1.9 in its unmodified original version
-- Have no files missing from DOOM II version 1.9
-- Have the IPXMATCH.xxx archive unzipped into your DOOM II directory
-- Not already be using a \IPXMATCH directory on your C: drive
-- Be loading the IM_INST.BAT batch file from your original DOOM II 
   version 1.9 directory
-- Not interrupt the IM_INST.BAT procedure

After IPXMATCH is installed, you can have a look at it in single-player mode
or start a deathmatch game.  Just follow your usual procedure for starting
the game (type "DOOM2" and press ENTER from the IPXMATCH directory).  Please 
note that since no pwads are required to play IPXMATCH, every player must 
install IPXMATCH successfully on his computer in order to be able to play 
IPXMATCH.

If you enter IPXMATCH in single-player mode, you can watch the provided 
presentation demos by waiting a few seconds after the IPXMATCH FINAL VERSION 
title screen is displayed.

A practical command-line parameter for every type of game is -DEVPARM.
Even if not required, it allows you to see the instant FPS (frame per second) 
rate (animation rate given in number of images displayed per second and
indicated at the bottom-left of the screen) and capture screens to PCX format 
using the F1 key in almost every case.  Notice that when -DEVPARM is used,
the HELP screen (which is replaced by a new one in IPXMATCH) is not available.

To calculate your instant FPS rate, use this formula:

                           70
INSTANT FPS RATE = ------------------
                   NUMBER OF DOTS + 1

One sample demo has been included with the IPXMATCH FINAL VERSION package:
INTENSE.LMP.  This sample demo was recorded during our NETDOOM 97 party.

To playback the demo, go to your IPXMATCH directory and type:

DOOM2 -DEVPARM -PLAYDEMO INTENSE

The "-DEVPARM" switch is optional but allows to calculate the instant frame
per second rate and capture screens using the F1 key.

Here is a list of the players who allowed me to record this demo:

Base:                     Bored of playing the original levels, bored of 
                          playing in the same levels every time I played a 
                          network game with my friends, bored of playing 
                          great and bad levels downloaded from internet 
                          which often contained a couple of weapons and 
                          almost no sufficient ammo in it, bored of 
                          downloading big pwads which only had a couple of 
                          interesting things, bored of playing pwads with too 
                          much modifications, bored of playing pwads which 
                          were created too fast and missed a certain quality, 
                          wanted change, wanted to get levels which would be 
                          great in four players games, wanted levels which 
                          would bring many hours of intense gaming, wanted 
                          the players to collapse from exhaustion and their
                          heads to pound on the keyboard before playing and 
                          knowing all the levels.

Editors used:             Please refer to the "credits" section.

KNOWN bugs:               None.  After 6.5 months of work and 1 month of beta
                          testing, IPXMATCH is kind of bug-free and ready to
                          use.  I have tried to be as perfectionnist as I
                          could with this project.  You will notice it by
                          having a look at the modifications I have done in
                          every level so they could be playable for a long
                          time without becoming bored.  In fact, I may admit
                          that there is one bug, but not caused by IPXMATCH.
                          The skies are normally supposed to be blue from
                          levels 1 to 11, orange in levels 12 to 20 and red
                          in levels 21 to 32.  If you warp into a level using 
                          a command line parameter, a front-end utility or a 
                          cheat code, the level's sky color will be right 
                          color.  But if you start the game on level 1 and 
                          progress toward the end of the game by finishing 
                          every level using the end-level switch (without 
                          cheating), the sky will remain blue.  This 
                          principle is the same if you warp in a level and 
                          continue progressing without cheating.  This bug 
                          is from the DOOM II game itself.  I cannot correct
                          it.

³      CORRECTED BUGS      ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ



Here are the bugs which have been corrected in the FINAL VERSION:

1) MAJOR BUG:  All the six deathmatch start positions on level 21 were in
               the same vicinity.  This is only a small mistake, but can
               lead to serious disadvantages in a deathmatch game (A player
               could easily get 30 frags per minute in a two-player game:
               the other player did always respawn in the same area).
               Probably this was caused by the idea of working on IPXMATCH
               at 3:00 am in the morning after a college party :-).

2) MINOR BUG:  The interior surface of the exit doors on levels 6 and 12 were
               drawn as "unpegged".  When opening the exit door from the
               inside, the texture shown a weird way of opening a door.  This
               was hard to spot, but annoying to know for a perfectionnist
               :-).

5) MINOR BUG:  The red sky in levels 21 to 32 had a few weird pixels in its
               dark spot.  I corrected the problem so it does not look like
               the vision of someone on acid anymore :-).

4) IMPROVEMENT: The background music importation technique has been improved:
                Musics are now imported using the MIDI2MUS converter.  This
                saves about 20% to 25% of space because MUS files are
                compressed.  Since I did not know that this was the way to 
                go, I previously used DEU to insert the MIDI files directly 
                into PWADS.  Even if the tunes played correctly in DOOM II, 
                it was impossible to play them in editors or rip them.  
                Sometimes it even caused some editors to crash :-).

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ



Here is where all the people who contributed to this deathmatch package
lay in glory.  Observe how many people were implicated in it.

The IPXMATCH project was started on 1997/04/18 and finished on 1997/10/31.
Its beta testing period started on 1997/11/01 and finished on 1997/11/30.

All the resources contained in IPXMATCH were compiled by Jeannot "NUMBeRsiX" 
Langlois and NOBODY else.

First of all, an infinite number of thanks to ID Software for providing us,
the players, an excellent game:  DOOM II.  Think about it:  played it since
1993 and still not bored of it!

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÍÍÍÍÍÍ FORGIVEN ONES ÍÍÍÍÍÍÄÄÄÄÄÄ


I am a human being as you are.  I am not a number, I am a free man!  I am
the great cornholio!  All lies lead to the truth! :-)  Just joking.  Let's 
get serious.  I do have the right to forget things.  However, I have made 
sure that everyone who has helped me with this package has had his name 
listed above.  Special cases are marked "? (Cannot remember)".  Those are
the names which I could not figure out, even after a great brain effort.
Sorry if I forgot your name.  Please accept my apologies.  I'm truly sorry.

On the other hand, some people's names could not be honored on this list 
because their identification was missing from the original resources I
borrowed them from.  These are identified as "Unknow (not mentioned)".

Parts which were created and or modified by me are credited to "Myself" or
to someone else and "Myself".  These cases are self-explanatory 
(modifications).


Enjoy IPXMATCH FINAL VERSION!

May the FRAGS be with you!

Never stop deathmatching!

Deathmatch games start but never end!

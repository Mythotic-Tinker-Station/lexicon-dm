Description             : 16 rather small and quite high-paced deathmatch
                          levels that I (Ola) originally started making for 
                          myself and some friends to play since everything 
                          else what too big or just plain ugly. (And we're 
                          too lazy to look for good levels :-)
                          Later I introduced Nicklas and Tobias to DOOM
                          editing and they started making maps for this
                          project too. Martin Friberg teamed up quite soon
                          to help us.

                          There are a few new textures in there, all being
                          commercial quality and no fucking MS Paint CRAP.

                          Any switches you find have to do with the exit.
                          There are no switches to reveal weapons or other
                          goodies.

Some thoughts from the 
aurhors of Overload:      If you think these levels are too small - go play
                          something else. Overloads levels are small because
                          we wanted them that way. You dont like respawnfrags?
                          You like to hunt your oponent? You hate symetric
                          levels? Then dont play Overload, because its not
                          made for you. However, if you feel like some
                          insanely fast DM play in damn good looking levels,
                          Overload is for you.

                          Some other things which has made these maps
                          symmetrical are the facts that they are small (in
                          case noone noticed) and if one made them irregular
                          it could give unfair disadvantages in forms of
                          starting points closer to weapons and such. Better
                          cover in some places. Since these maps are lightning
                          fast, everyone should play on the same conditions as
                          your enemy.
                          In bigger maps everyone has LOTS of time planning
                          out a strategy compared to these.

Known Bugs              : The slime-trail bug appears in some levels.
                          We have done our best to remove this by running
                          levels through DMAPEDITs nodebuilder (quite
                          efficient with this bug) and BSP 2.4b, but some
                          lightshadings can still cause the slime trails
                          to show at certain angles, like in map03 and 4.
May Not Run With...     : DOOM Legacy, DosDOOM and ZDoom. Well, it WILL run,
                          but the sky will look really ugly or tile in
                          strange ways if you use mlook. Mlook is for Quack,
                          and not DOOM, anyways. Also, *some* of the source 
                          ports that support high resolutions will have the
                          map titles and stuff wrong. Blame them, not us.

Title                   : Fragtastic
Author                  : Ola Bjorling
Description             : 4 Pillars is all you have to hide behind. This is
                          a shotguns-only level. Lots of respawnfrags, but
                          it's quite easy to fool your opponent as you 
                          respawn...
Construction time       : About 10 hours (had to redo it from scratch since
                          EdMap felt like eating it. Argh!) The texture 
                          aligning took ages.

                          Learn to aim or you'll frag yourself with the

                          high-paced.
                          Nicklas did the basic layout while Ola cleaned
                          it up and added some decorative details.

Description             : Probably the most detailed map in the WAD. The old
                          Norse Gods must have been kind to Nicklas and done
                          some kick-ass node calculating as thanks for the
                          maps name. Otherwise it'd get a VPO for sure.

                          have a huge advantage! See the demo in the WAD.
                          I would have put more detail in there if it wasn't
                          for the Visplane limit.

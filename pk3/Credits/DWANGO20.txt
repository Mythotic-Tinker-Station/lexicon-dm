Description: 31 maps created between 1994 and 1998 by the Dooming community of yesteryear, and a map by myself. There's a nice mix of duel maps and all-out FFA maps which seem to have been lost in time, and I thought it was appropriate for Dwango's 20th anniversary to bring them back to the surface! All of these WADs give consent for distribution - check DWANGO20_DOCS for more information. Map01 was created in the spirit of DWANGO and can also be found in DK_DM_2.wad, but this version is better :)

A big shoutout to all the BBS sysops of the 1990's for providing custom DOOMing action even in the technological stone-age, and to John Romero himself for being the only one at ID to get excited about/support the DWANGO service, a huge milestone in online gaming!

Description             : This WAD contains 5 maps designed specifically for
			  DooM 2 Deathmatch 1.0  The chosen skill level
			  changes what weapons are available (see below).

			  MAP 1: Smallish enclosed area with a couple of
			  small halls on one side, and 2 sets of stairs
			  that allow access to other areas.

			  MAP 2: Pit with stair access, some sniping zones
			  which hook into an outside courtyard.

			  MAP 3: Medium-small sized lower area, with a
			  ledge on one side, stairs on two others.  Hall-
			  ways connect the low area to the ledge.

			  MAP 4: Nice open area with some raised areas.
			  Some halls off the side contain some weapons.  A
			  couple of high areas let you see what's going on.
			  Nice outdoor ceiling effects!

			  MAP 5: Courtyard with trees connects to an
			  enclosed area.  Part of the enclosed area is
			  semi-open and the rest is separated with doors.

Additional Credits to   : Some of my friends for being such wonderful
			  fodder for testing =>  and some of the guys on
			  iFrag for giving me feed-back on these.

* That See Below Stuff *

The skill levels are implemented as follows:

Skill 4/5: All the weapons!

Skill 3: Everything but the BFG9000

Skill 1/2 Only the Shotgun, Super Shotgun, and Chain gun

Note: on MAP 10 the torches that line the stairs are removed on the
      lower skill levels.

As any player will tell you; try to look through the levels before you
play them.  It makes life sooo much easier.

There are no monsters in the levels, as they are small enough for 2
players and they just get in the way!

Feel free to send me feed-back or suggestions for levels.  I am fairly
new to WAD editing and may have missed something important in these.

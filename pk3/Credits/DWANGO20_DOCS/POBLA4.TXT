Description             : After a long pause, here is the next 
                          level of my DM-level series. Very well
                          designed. This one is a special level,
                          because it is based on the test map 1
                          from Quake - yes, Quake. Damn job 
                          converting real-3D to Doom-3D, but it
                          is worth the time, take a look and 
                          compare - it is incredible. :)

                          THIS IS NO CRAP!
                          TiC stands for quality. Remember that.

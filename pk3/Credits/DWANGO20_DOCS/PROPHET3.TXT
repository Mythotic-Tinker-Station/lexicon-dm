Description             :This is going to prove to be an insane multi-player
                         wad. Inside you will find a large wall holding a very    
                         large amount of water. Below all of this is the lower
                         level which is surrounded on both sides by staircases
                         and two elevators- one is an instant lift and the 
                         other leads to the plasma rifle.. here is where the
                         real fun starts. The plasma rifle is on a tall column
                         inside the slow elevator. Once the elevator has risen
                         high enough to get on the column, you must get the
                         plasma gun and get off the elevator before your 
                         buddies lock you in the cage and score a very unfair 
                         (but fair still) frag on you. It's a lot of fun.. 
                         try it!

Description              : This Wad is for DOOM ][ only. 
                           A deathmatch level.
                           A small predictable wad.
                           There is a central room with a bfg surronded by
                           four other rooms containing the other weapons.
                           All the rooms are connected.
                           If you want to know any more you'll have
                           to play it.
                                 
Additional Credits to    : Playtesters Paul Pennington (may your
                           mouse always be an osborne) and Liam Orford
                           (If you shoot one more rocket at me
                           I will rip your head off.)

                           Also I must thank the security guard
                           who stopped us playing so we could
                           do some work.

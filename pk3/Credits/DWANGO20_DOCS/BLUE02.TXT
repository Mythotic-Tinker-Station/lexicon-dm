Misc. Author Info       : Heh heh heh, I love to kill.

Description             : This is a small intense deathmatch level.
                          It contains all of the weapons but the BFG, 
                          little health, and no armor.

                          Named "The Iron Cross" for its shape, this level
                          features fast action in close quarters and an 
                          elegant design.

                          A great break from those levels where your frag
                          counter isn't a blur.

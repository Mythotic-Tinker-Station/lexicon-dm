Misc. Author Info     : I was inspired by the great wad stoker2.wad.
			I wanted to create one with the same detail and
			realism.  I wanted a wad where you can go to a
			room and know exactly what the room is
			suppose to be.  I want you to be able to say, 
			"cool, this looks just like a church",
			or "Wow! What a graveyard!"   Please, if you like
			this WAD (or not), send me feedback so that in the 
			future I can make even better levels.

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : MAP 1 (doom2 -file church.wad)
Single Player           : Yes. Your goal is to get the blue shere and get
			  back in one piece.

			  I would recommend "Hurt me Plenty" to learn the
			  map, but play "Ultra Violence" for a real game.

Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes (Same as single player).  Though, might be 
			  too small for more than 2 people.

Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes.  Tested with 2, 3, and 4 players.
			  If you're playing with monsters, I recommend
			  "Hey not too rough" (-skill 2).  The harder
			  skill levels were mainly for single player; it
			  may have too many monster for deathmatch (but of
			  course thats up to you!)
			  Altdeath and respawn highly recommended.

Difficulty Settings     : Yes 
New Sounds              : no
New Graphics            : Yes
New Music               : no
Demos Replaced          : no

Description:

 - Designed for Doom II deathmatch ( -altdeath highly recommended ).

 - This level is a small courtyard with a church, a crypt, and a 
   mausoleum.  Points of interest also include a graveyard and
   men burning at the stakes.

 - Every area has at least two exits so you can't get trapped in.

 - NO LAVA PITS!

 - NO COOPERATIVE EXITS! (gosh I hate those).  The exit is right there in
   the courtyard.  It's a cool looking exit, but be careful of accidentally
   exiting.

 - No BFG.

 - Plenty of ammo and health.

 - The coolest part of this wad (in my opinion) is the church and its
   "preacher" raising hell and brimestone.  I would play it in "Ultraviolence"
   just to see him 'preach' on his congregation and you.


My apologies if I offended anyone for having a duel to the death inside
of a church.

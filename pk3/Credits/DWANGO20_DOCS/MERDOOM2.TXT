Date                    : May 15, 1995
Title                   : MerDoom II
Filename                : MERDOOM2.WAD
Authors                 : Brent C Marvich  
			  Ted Peterson    
Email Addresses         : glide@jax-inter.net
			  Merlock@
Misc. Author Info       : This level is my second creation I made.
			  I made it for Ted because I owed him a 
			  favor.

Description (read this!): To play this level the correct way you 
			  must use DooM2.  Actually any version of 
			  DooM2 will work (1.666-1.9) but to view 
			  the demo that has been added you must use
			  DooM2 version 1.9.  


Additional Credits to   : Raphael Quinet and Brendon J. Weber for
			  DEU and of course id for Doom!  All the
			  people who designed all the software I
			  used (listed below).  And everybody that
			  supports my wad creation efforts, because
			  without them I would not even make these
			  levels.

Comments : I am a perfectionist, which means this level has no flaws
	   in it.  I spent about 5 of the 10 hours creating this wad
	   just testing and looking at everything to make sure it all
	   matched...This level has a lot of dark (pitch black) area's
	   in it (that is the way Ted likes them) but I think it is 
	   one of the best deathmatch levels available.  there are a 
	   lot of secrets in this level, you will have to be very 
	   observant to find them.

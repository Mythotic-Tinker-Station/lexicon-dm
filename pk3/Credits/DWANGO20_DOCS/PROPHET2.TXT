Description             :A relatively small/medium-small Deathmatch wad 
                         resembling something out of a science fiction movie. 
                         Play is fast and gruesome.  If you must have the
                         BFG it won't be at no cost. :)
Additional Credits to   :The Dweller in the Cellar for his awesome levels,
                         all my deathmatch pals who have helped me playtest,
                         and of course the obvious.

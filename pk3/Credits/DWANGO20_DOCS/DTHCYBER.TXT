Description             : 1 level death match wad.  There is one monster,
						  a Cyberdemon, perched up in the middle of the level
						  guarding the BFG.  The level is structured in such
						  a way that he can get you from almost anywhere, so
						  he sort of acts like an equalizer for inexperienced
						  players!

						  The level has excellent lighting, 99.9% perfect
						  texture alignment and contains some of my best
						  architecture to date.  The teleports were inspired
						  by the Quake preview, as was the staircase beside
						  the lava pool.

						  - NO keys.
						  - NO doors.
						  - NO puzzles.

						  Just complete and total carnage!

Additional Credits      : iD for DOOM2.
						  Ben Morris for DCK.
						  Mike Reed for the inspiration to finish this thing.

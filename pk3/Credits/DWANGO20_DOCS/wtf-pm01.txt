WTF Productions is proud to present an original Doom WAD...

Title                   : PiGMaN 1

Description             : Simple(ish) layout. One largish area
                          intended for free flowing duels. The rest is
                          more tight. Basically a circle with a cross
                          in the middle and one corner of the circle
                          made much larger. The left hand side is high
                          - steps round the outer part of the level
                          and though the middle. An excellent level for
                          double backs and cut off manovers. Lurking
                          is not very profitable
                           
                          BFG and plasma are hard to get. Plasma on a
                          lift BFG on a strafe run platform. Personally
                          I think the DB shotgun RULES this level
                          though..
                           
                          Skill 1 has been optimized for alt-deathmatch.
                          All other skill levels are meant for REAL
                          deathmatch :) One bit of armour and various
                          health and ammo bits lying about. Lots of
                          S.shotguns on this skill level so you don't
                          run out too quick.

                          Medium has no cell weapons and hard is my
                          fav.... all weapons no messing.

Misc. Author Info       :Just plain goofy 
Description             :It's 12 noon (yeah that's right rp) :) in an area
                         circling a large canopy of rock which I took from  
                         my single player wad called 2drkprk.wad (sometimes
                         found as prophet.zip). 
                         I like this one a lot and I think it rivals 
                         Prophet2.  Once again, If you must 
                         have the BFG it won't be at no cost. :)

Misc. Author Info       : 19yr old computing student who's having
                          a blast with the uni's network!

                          "Could I kill you anymore than i
                           have already?... I dont think so"

Description             : Rest in peace? Hah! Not here... >=)

                          Small layout that absolutely goes off
                          in a 4 player game. 2 player is just
                          as cool.

                          Stay on your toes and dont go deaf or
                          you may miss that vital welp of pain
                          from the lava.

                          If you run out of ammo then your doing
                          great!

Strategy                : The plasma can REALLY kick some ass
                          here, So if you hear/see someone
                          grabbing it cover that TELEPORT!

                          Same goes for the bfg. Use it to take
                          out any annoying plasma CAMPERS or
                          stand under the rocket launcher to
                          get a big view of the level and waste
                          MULTIPLE opponents.

                          Grabbing the plasma and shooting thru
                          the grates is a good way for CHEAP
                          frags. It can really throw a 4 player
                          game into MAYHEM for the other three
                          people who have to watch their step!

                          Also camping in the ssg alcove
                          results in angry, DEAD but angry,
                          opponents.

                          Dont loose your cool if you get fragged
                          something like 20 times in quick succession
                          in a 4 player game. It just happens.

                          Just grab a big gun and shoot back!

Description             : A set of 4 deathmatch levels, sort of the sequel to Hafwads.
                          These are levels that were partway built when I started
                          playing Quake and quit Doom II editing.  They are all close
                          to complete, but are of varying quality level.  Frankly, I
                          don't know how good they are since I am writing this over a
                          year after the last time I played Doom.

Additional Credits to   : Id, of course.
                          And someone else- I copied the basic idea for CHEESE from a
                          level I'd played before.  My level is roughly the same size
                          and shape with similar item placement.  I remember that
                          there were some really annoying things about this level, so
                          I ripped off the idea and made what I consider a much better
                          one.  I can't name the author or even the name of that map
                          because I don't remember.  If someone happens to notice a
                          level that looks like this, feel free to mail me and I'll
                          add the proper credit...

                          I may have fixed this.  I don't recall...

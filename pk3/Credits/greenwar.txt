* Bug Fixes *

From beta version 1 to beta version 1a

When viewing map15 of GWbeta1.wad in single player mode you would be instantly
telefragged and thus would not be able to view it in single player mode.

From beta version 1a to GreenWar

Several of the maps had unattainable items (they were stuck in walls)  A missing step
texture was also fixed.  NOTE:  The missing lower texture on the lift in map13 is
intentional!  It's so you can see what's going on while you're waiting for the lift
to rise.

* Description*

32 fun DM maps (well, there's like 2 in here that aren't that fun but I included them anyway)
The texturing of the wads is a bit drab.  That's the main reason this is a beta.  Some
maps may have some playability issues.  ie: going down those stairs is a pain cause I
keep hitting my head.  Things like that.  There shoulnd't be anymore bugs.  Extensive testing
on most maps has been done, but not all.

Description             : In case you couldn't tell, this is a dedication to
			  Ola Bjorling's uber cool Overload.

                          It currently features 8 high paced frag filled
                          levels in the style of Overload and all new
                          textures (mostly "inspired" by the original
                          Overload textures).  The textures don't look quite
                          so awesome as the originals, but we're not allowed
                          to use them.  Oh yeah, some textures are inspired
                          by some of Ola's Darkening E1 textures too.  So
                          ph33r.
				                                                 
Additional Credits to   : The whole team would like to thank:

			  * Ola and friends for one of the greatest DM level
			    sets of all time

			  Nick thanks:

			  * The authors of DeeP '97 and WinTex
			  * All the people who've shown me how crap I am at
			    playing DM
			  * The people who realise that they could upgrade
			    their 486 to a Pentium with a single day's wages
			    nowadays.
			  * America for having hardly any local Doom servers,
                            while England has one throughout the entire
                            country, ie BT's own Wireplay service.  So ph33r
                            us Brits! =P

			  David thanks:

			  * Ola Bjorling and the rest of the Overload Team
                            for their awesome Overload set.  You like frags?
                            You'll like this. members.xoom.com/bjorling
			  * Nick Baker for starting this Overload Tribute
			    Project.

			  Martin thanks:

			  * Ben Morris for DCK.
                          * Rand Phares for his great Doom Consitency
                            Checker.

			  Mike Watson thanks:

                          * Matt Ayres for WadEd (even though it's got way too
                            many bugs.
                          * Anyone who helped me out with any kind of
                            level editing for Doom (they know who they are...
                            or maybe they don't...).
                          * Ola, cause without him, Surge would be
                            Overload and we'd all have nothing to make it
                            a tribute to (you think anyone will make a
                            tribute to Surge?).


			  Jesse thanks:
   			
			  * Everyone, Matthew Ayres too, especially if he
                            releases the WadEd Source.

			  Qingshuo thanks:

			  * No fuck'n thanX to BrewBoy.

			  Yashar thanks:

			    involving me.
			  * Chrozoron for different reasons.

			  Mike Reid thanks:

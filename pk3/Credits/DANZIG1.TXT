* Important Notes *

        Danzig1 is a set of five tight, fast levels designed to provide for 
intense DOOM ][ Deathmatches.  I've included support for various modes of play 
as follows:
        
        1.  Original Deathmatch rules ("I'm Too Young To Die" and "Hey, Not 
            Too Rough" support this) 
            
        2.  Deathmatch 2.0 rules ("Hurt Me Plenty" supports this) 
        
        3.  What I call "Expert" mode ("Ultraviolent" and "Nightmare" support 
            this)  
        
Support for Deathmatch 2.0 has been altered from previous Danzig levels to 
better provide for -altdeath play.  Original Deathmatch is now basically the 
same setup as Expert mode without any plasma weapons.  Expert mode still has 
very little health and ammo, but DOES include almost every weapon per level 
(including the BFG).  Use Expert mode if you want access to the more powerful 
weapons.
        I've also included monster support - monsters are placed 
strategically to add spice to the game.  Usually players don't need this in
a three- or four-player game, but sometimes a two-person game can get a 
little slow.  Either way you like it, BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE RESPAWN OPTION
WHEN USING MONSTERS in your Deathmatches.
        Also note that none of these levels involve cooperative exits.  Find-
ing each exit should be simple; however, if you have any questions use a level 
editor or send me email for assistance.        
        Please take a walk through these levels before you actually use them 
in Deathmatch.  While danzig1 is extremely straightforward, it's always nice 
to get a feel for new levels before you begin.  I'm open to any comments/  
suggestions you may have, so please send me email!  
        Thanks for using Danzig!

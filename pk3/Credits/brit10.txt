TITLE                   | THE BRITISH DOOM ][ LEAGUE: SEASON 10
FILENAME                | BRIT10.WAD
                        |
==============================================================================
                        |
Map 1                   | "EXHALE"
Info                    | Created by Danny. Good mobility and varied tactics
                        | are required.
Changes for Brit10      | The 'pillars' have been simplified somewhat.
Speed Rating            | Fast - Frantic
                        |
Map 2                   | "OPEN AIR"
Info                    | Created by Yeti. Definitely needs quick thinking,
                        | plus patience to learn a variety of shots.
Changes for Brit10      | None were needed.
Speed Rating            | Fast
                        |
Map 3                   | "POINT BLANK #3"
Info                    | Created by Panza. Classic Deathmatching with an
                        | evenly spread feel.
Changes for Brit10      | Respawns and weapon placements have been altered
                        | so as to cater for better 2-player action.
Speed Rating            | Medium
                        |
Map 4                   | "M.J.D. 1"
Info                    | Created by Slartibartfast. Simple Deathmatching,
                        | but there are one or two shots you should learn...
Changes for Brit10      | Has had quite a face lift this one, with a few
                        | structural changes too.
Speed Rating            | Medium - Fast
                        |
Map 5                   | "THE TOWER"
Info                    | Created by Yeti. Started so simple, but then from
                        | the darkest areas of Stu's mind ... came this!
                        | Be afraid ... be VERY AFRAID.
Changes for Brit10      | None were needed.
Speed Rating            | Frantic.
                        |
Map 6                   | "CANCER"
Info                    | Created by Munyul. Small but way too compact, this
                        | should get your pulse going berzerk ! Often very
                        | hard not to suicide with the rocket launcher; the
                        | best offensive is sometimes to just stay cool.
Changes for Brit10      | Made easier to get the BFG, added a single barrel
                        | and general tidying up.
Speed Rating            | Intense.
                        |
Map 7                   | "PAIN 4 ALL"
Info                    | Created by Dominion. Timing is essential on this
                        | map, with plenty of opportunity to second guess
                        | your opponent.
Changes for Brit10      | Slightly compressed for faster gameplay, plus a lot
                        | of tidying up.
Speed Rating            | Medium - Fast.
                        |
                        |
Extra Credits, thanks   | Danny and Yeti for spending countless hours
                        | perfecting Brit10, to hopefully make the best B.D.L
                        | release to date.
                        | All the members who took the time to vote for 5
                        | levels from Voting10 - Brit10 wouldn't have been as
                        | good without your votes.
                        |

                        | To view the recordings, just start up Doom with
                        | British10 and wait for a few seconds; they will
                        | then run one after another; with a short gap
                        | between each one.
                        |

* Footnote from Danny *

There are TWO bonus maps, making SEVEN in total (rather than the usual FIVE).
This was done to add extra choice and more varied challenges for the ensuing
10th season of the B.D.L I hope you appreciate the extra effort that has
gone into this compilation, as a result.

I've tried (along with Yeti & Karl) to implement everyone's ideas when making
changes to British10, whilst hopefully still retaining the level's original
good qualities. Please bear in mind that they were made only to add to your
enjoyment when deathmatching - rather than use bias to cater for the tastes of
a few individuals. Other than that, I hope you see British10 as being the best
BDL Deathmatch Wad-Pack to date !

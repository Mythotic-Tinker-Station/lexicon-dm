Description          : Welcome to EXECUTION, 18 high-speed deathmatch levels
		       all designed with head-to-head gameplay in mind.
		       As well as quality gameplay, these levels feature new
		       textures, flats, ambience and graphics to make these
		       levels look, feel and sound just as great as they play,
		       which some deathmatch levels don't have.

Credits to           : A huge thanks goes to Nick Baker and Schronzki for their
		       time and effort in fixing the enormous texture problems 
		       encountered in about 14 levels, as well as all the other 
		       level designers and members in the team.
		       
		       Credit goes to the members involved in the GOTHICDM
		       series for inspiration.

		       ... and YOU for downloading Execution!

Greets to	     : Everyone in the doom community, and probably all the
		       members that _used_ to be in the British Doom League which
		       died years ago... :-|
		       
====[ EXECUTION PLAY INFORMATION ]===================================================

Episode and Level #     : MAP01-MAP16, MAP31, MAP32
Single Player           : Hmmm, well just to learn the spawning spots.
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yeah, let's go collect some pretty blue potions...
			  (and for the gay doomers out there, I was being sarcastic).
Deathmatch 2 Player     : FUKIN' HELL YEAH!!!
Deathmatch 3 Player	: Yeah, it'll probably work.
Deathmatch 4 Player	: Possibly, if you're crazy enough
Difficulty Settings     : Designed for skill 3 or 4 on old deathmatch rules,
			  skill 5 is not recommended unless you're looking for a very
			  unfair game...
New Sounds              : Yes (Featuring ambience effects, leave monsters in the game 
			  to hear. Also featuring some 22Khz in-game sound effects!)
New Graphics            : Yes, including new textures.
New Music               : Yes (all original tracks, also worth listening to!)
			  (NOTE: Due to the intense complexity of some of the tracks,
			  you may notice a slowdown in the game speed, depending on
			  what device you've chosen for MIDI output.)
Demos Replaced          : Yes (Note: The connection was quite sluggish though...)
			  There are 4 demos in the wad, you can view the forth demo if
			  you're running Final Doom or one of the doom source ports
			  such as DosDOOM, Boom, Legacy, etc, or just by adding
			  -playdemo demo4 (ignore the 'couldn't find demo4' message)

====[ THE LEVELS ]=====================================================================

-=# MAP01: Hysteria #=-----------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Vincent Fong
Music		:	"Mad 'n' Mental" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	Great level to test your shotgun skills.

-=# MAP02: Death to all #=-------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Justin Saunders, Vincent Fong
Music		:	"Intense Follower" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	This level used to be an addictive classic during the
			days of the British Doom League, and has now been
			resurrected with some fancy architecture and extended
			fragging opportunities.

-=# MAP03: Day for Death #=------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Justin Saunders, Vincent Fong
Music		:	Untitled (Steve Fontaine)
Notes		:	This is yet again another classic from Justin Saunders,
			and was one of the very popular maps during the times
			when BBSes were used for multiplayer dooming. Now
			revamped, this level is badder than ever!
			(Note: An evil suprise waits in the exit, just look out
			the window!)

-=# MAP04: Caged #=--------------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Vincent Fong, Luke Cama
Music		:	Untitled (Marc A. Pullen)
Notes		:	It's a known fact that many deathmatch doomers can get
			really pissed off by BFG wussies fragging them							constantly. Grabbing the BFG in this level is a risk,
			so becareful!

-=# MAP05: Destroyer #=----------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Vincent Fong
Music		:	"Destroyer" (Issac Wycoff)
Notes		:	One of the best maps in this deathmatch wad. This
			fast-paced level can really test your accuracy to the
			limits! Since this level isn't particularly big,
			you'll have to be pretty quick if you're gonna get
			away with a Plasma Rifle or a BFG without taking a
			mouthful of lead!

-=# MAP06: Pain for all #=-------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Justin Saunders, Vincent Fong
Music		:	"For your INSANITY!" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	Yet another of Justin's classic maps. Since the
			original version of this level was so playable, this
			level hardly needed any changes.
			NOTE: This level appeared in Season 10 of the British
			Doom League pack of levels where the BFG and Plasma
			Gun were switched around from the original map. Though
			many doom players found this an improvement, Justin
			requested that this level should have the original
			weapon placements when released in Execution.
			To play with Justin's original weapon placement, play
			on SKILL 3. To switch the BFG and Plasma Rifle, play
			on SKILL 4.

-=# MAP07: Abbatoir Re-dux #=----------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Nick Baker
Music		:	"Techno-X" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	A revamped version of the Abbatoir level in one of 
			Nick's deathmatch level pack "Realms of Pain".
			The gameplay in this level has miracoulously
			improved from the original due to it's new larger
			size. This level plays in a somewhat similar
			fashion to DOOM2 MAP01 as the players will find
			themselves using the other weapons a bit more
			often as well as the super shotgun.

-=# MAP08: Plague #=-------------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Vincent Fong
Music		:	Untitled (Marc A. Pullen)
Notes		:	Extensively detailed map, as well as a very fast-paced
			map. You can pull off some pretty harsh BFG shots in this
			level...

-=# MAP09: Vengeance #=----------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Vincent Fong
Music		:	"Headache" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	Hunt 'n' kill deathmatching action. Becareful when going
			for the plasma gun or BFG as you could be exposed to
			some pelting! When you think you've had enough, just
			take a leap into the pit waiting behind the exit door...

-=# MAP10: Rage Within #=--------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Luke Cama
Music		:	"Hardass" (Issac Wycoff)
Notes		:	The wide open area makes a great shotgun battle ground.

-=# MAP11: Nihilist #=-----------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Simon Howard
Music		:	"The Execution Thang" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	Dark corridor deathmatching! Watch out for those rockets!

-=# MAP12: Time to Kill 2000 #=--------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Justin Saunders, Nick Baker
Music		:	"Enraged to Kill" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	People who played doom on multiplayer BBSes in the UK voted
			this as one of the most popular deathmatch levels they've
			ever played.
			Now this level is back with an extended area (for those who
			played the old version) to maximize the gameplay for a
			hunt 'n' kill battle frenzy!

-=# MAP13: Dead Set #=-----------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Luke Cama
Music		:	"Painful Headcases" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	Getting the BFG in this level is easy enough, getting it
			without being easily blasted with a shotgun is another
			thing... becareful!

-=# MAP14: Fast Frag 2000 1st Blood #=-------------------------------------------------
-=# MAP15:                2nd Blood #=-------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Luke Cama, Simon Howard, Nick Baker, Schronzki
Music		:	"Kill 'em!" (Issac Wycoff)
Notes		:	The original version of Fast Frag made it's debut in
			TeamOnslaught's DECAMATCH and was originally designed for
			4 players. Now this level has been given one huge
			face-lift, and has also been split into 2 seperate levels
			for suitable head-to-head action.
			These levels are purely designed for simple bullet pelting
			deathmatching, featuring no BFG or Plasma gun like in the
			original Fast Frag. Great for humiliating BFG-welders who
			can't aim a real man's gun!

-=# MAP31: Scatter #=------------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Luke Cama
Music		:	Untitled (Pete Tomaselli)
Notes		:	Again, BFG looks easy to get. But you'll then be in the
			centre of death as you'll be a wide open target!

-=# MAP32: Gallows #=------------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Echo
Music		:	"The Paranoiac Feeling" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	No BFG in this level, just a purely intense level.

-=# MAP16: Ex'ed #=--------------------------------------------------------------------
Author(s)	:	Schronzki
Music		:	"Execution Crazy Remix" (Vincent Fong)
Notes		:	This last but small level is enough to send your pulse 
			going crazy! Just play it and find out!
